NBA's 3 Point Shooting Trend

## Introduction
Anyone who have been watching NBA games would have noticed that the league has started shooting more threes. The top winning teams are also the best 3-point shooting teams. Do 3-point shootings actually lead to winning in the NBA?

In this project, I: (1) explore possible correlations between 3-point shooting and the winning, and (2) predict the 2016-2017 season results of each team, based on the correlations.
